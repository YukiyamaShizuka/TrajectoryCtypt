# TrajectoryCrypt

**TrajectoryCrypt** is a novel encryption paradigm based on behavioral trajectories, logic feedback, and path-based identity anchoring.

Unlike traditional encryption systems that rely on key-value pairs or mathematical transformations, TrajectoryCrypt creates a multi-solution function `f(x)` derived from path feedback under entropy noise. The function is public, but only the creator can identify the correct input through behavioral memory.
