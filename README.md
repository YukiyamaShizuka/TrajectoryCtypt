## About the Developer

TrajectoryCrypt is independently designed and implemented by Yukiyama Shizuka.  
This project is part of a long-term vision to explore encryption systems rooted in path behavior and structure logic, rather than centralized keys or brute-force resistance.

As an individual researcher and system architect, Yukiyama maintains this project without institutional or corporate backing.  
Contributions in the form of dialogue, peer review, or conceptual discussion are always welcome.
